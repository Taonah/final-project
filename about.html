                      <p>In today's fast-paced world, people are often too busy to run errands themselves.
                         Equerry is an errand platform where people can hire others to do their errands. 
                         The website offer various types of errands that people could register for and provides
                        a list of reliable runners who are available to complete these tasks. 
                         By doing so, it would create job opportunities for those who are looking for 
                         flexible work and at the same time helps those who are unable to complete their
                          errands due to time constraints.
                          . Users who need errands done can then browse through the available runners and choose the one
                           who best suits their needs. The website could also have a rating system where users can leave 
                           feedback on the performance of the runner which can help to build trust and ensure users are 
                           making the right choice. Overall, the website will be a great way to create a community of
                            people who want to help each other out and make life easier for those with busy schedules. 
                            Additionally, the website could provide safety
                           measures such as background checks and secure payment options for both parties involved. >
