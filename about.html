                      <p>In today's fast-paced world, people are often too busy to run errands themselves.
                         Equerry is an errand platform where people can hire others to do their errands. 
                         The website offer various types of errands that people could register for and provides
                        a list of reliable runners who are available to complete these tasks. 
                         By doing so, it would create job opportunities for those who are looking for 
                         flexible work and at the same time helps those who are unable to complete their
                          errands due to time constraints. </p>
